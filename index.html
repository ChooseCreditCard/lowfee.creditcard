        <h1>How Low-Fee Credit Cards Work — And When They Make Sense</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many credit cards advertise “low fees”, but the term can mean different things: no annual fee, low FX fees,
          low APR, or simply fewer hidden charges. This site breaks down what low-fee structures actually look like —
          in plain, neutral language.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Counts as a Low-Fee Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A low-fee card usually keeps its pricing straightforward: a low or zero annual fee, predictable FX fees,
        and minimal added charges. These cards often focus on simplicity over perks like lounges or travel insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are ideal for users who value affordability, budgeting clarity, and predictable monthly statements.
      </p>

    <!-- Fee Breakdown -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>Types of Fees That Affect Total Cost</h2>
      <p>What makes a card genuinely low-fee depends on your usage pattern. Here are the main cost drivers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual fee:</strong> Many low-fee cards charge €0–€30 per year.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign transaction fees:</strong> A card may be “low-fee” domestically but expensive abroad if FX fees are high.</li>
        <li><strong>ATM withdrawal fees:</strong> Some inexpensive cards add charges for cash withdrawals.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest / APR:</strong> If you carry a balance, interest becomes the biggest cost — even on a low-fee card.</li>
        <li><strong>Late or penalty fees:</strong> Important for budgeting users who want predictability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The best low-fee card is one that minimizes the fees that <strong>you</strong> are most likely to encounter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Trade-offs -->
    <section id="tradeoffs" class="section">
      <h2>Trade-Offs With Low-Fee Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping fees low means cutting back on premium perks. These cards typically limit:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Airport lounges</li>
        <li>Travel insurance coverage</li>
        <li>High reward multipliers</li>
        <li>Exclusive partner benefits</li>
        <li>Larger credit limits</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But for many users, predictable low cost is worth more than premium extras they would never use.
